## How to use

* Copy your search terms into the top textarea
* click search
* look at the results in the bottom table
* eventually use the `prepare raw` button to have an easy-to-copy
  version of the links.

## Other tools

* I added a button to automatically prepend a text to all the
  search terms in the top text area

## Compatibility

* results (after the counters have been removed) can be pasted in a txt
  file ready to be used with [youtube-dl](http://rg3.github.com/youtube-dl/):

    $ youtube-dl --extract-audio --audio-format mp3 -t -A -a /tmp/download_links
